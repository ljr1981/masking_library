		Virtues of Clickable-view & Notes
		=================================
		When viewing notes in the editor, embedded references which are Pick-and-Droppable in
		the Clickable-view are not when in the general editing view. Moreover, only classes
		which are "in-system" will have their features, clients, supplies, and so on viewable
		in the various tools. Therefore, based on these items, you will want to pick-and-drop
		"in-system" "classes-of-interest" (your interest) into the Class-tool and select the
		Clickable-view tool as your primary reader -OR- you will want to change the editor to
		the Clickable-view in order to explore (i.e. you are learning and not coding, so you
		want to use the Clickable-view in the editor to explore with while learning).
		
		One will find an advantage by viewing the class and its notes in the editor under the
		Clickable-view. When this is so, you may pick and drop a CLASS or Feature reference to
		the Class or Feature tool in this IDE.
		
		Known Editor Bugs
		=================
		There are presently bugs in the Eiffel Studio editor that work against good documentation
		exploration in the Clickable-view. Primarily, Tab characters and Unicode characters will
		be removed from the view in Clickable-view, but are shown in the Editable-view. Clearly,
		this behavior is against the purpose of the Clickable-view.

		In-system: A class is termed "in-system" when it is referenced by a Client, which is
		in-turn referenced by another Client, and all the way back to the "root-class" of the
