PLEASE READ COMPLETELY!
=======================
If you have opened this file for the first time, we encourage you to read it completely and understand it as well as you can before moving on to the library code, clusters, and classes. It is important that you understand the structure and context of the learning facilities that have been used to aid your rapid learning capacity with this software package.


Overview
========
View the documentation of this library through the Eiffel Studio IDE by opening the mask ECF project, mask target. Find the DOC_LIBRARY_MASK class as a starting point for LEARNING about this library.


Documentation Structure
=======================
The documentation structure, layout, and organization is designed around a simple and powerful principle: You cannot use and reuse what you cannot learn! If you can learn it, you can reuse it! Since this principle is based in the reality of your human learning process, we have attempted to assist your ability to rapidly learn this library by organizing, structuring, and laying out the documentation of this library in such a way that it will (hopefully) facilitate your ability to learn and reuse the classes and facilities of this library as rapidly as possible.

If you find this to not be true or if you have suggestions or other comments, we (the Eiffel Software & Jinny Corp. JLOFT teams) welcome your feedback.


Where to Begin
==============
Open the Eiffel Studio IDE and begin reading at the DOC_LIBRARY_MASK class, which can be found as a cluster in the root "mask" cluster. Locate this in the "Groups" tool in Eiffel Studio.


How to Read (What to Expect)
============================
When you open the DOC_LIBRARY_MASK class, you will want to take your time to first familiarize yourself with the documentation structure.

Library, Cluster, Class, and Class-feature level notes are expressed as Note-entry constructs (see ECMA-367 8.4.3 Page 34). Each Note-name represents a category of information. The categories are arranged with the intent of being read top-to-bottom as Master-to-Beginner level of information. Thus, when you become more familiar with the library, you ought to expect to find the information at the top of the Note-list as the ones being more helpful. As a Beginner with the library, you ought to expect to read more of the Note-list Note-entry items to gain the orientation and understanding you need to rapidly reuse the library.

(See Appendix A for Category Definitions)

Located at the bottom of each class are notes to help you and remind you of best-practice ways of reading, utilizing, and learning through the documentation contained in the classes. These operational notes may change from time to time as the library or Eiffel Studio (or both) mature and change. You may want to periodically visit these notes to remain fresh and aware of good-form when learning an Eiffel Library.

Note that you will not find all of the Note-entry categories in every case. This is because they do not apply all the time to everything. They are only included when information befitting that category needs to be communicated to you for the purpose of your rapid learning.

Additionally, not every software element will have a Notes construct. While a Library and Cluster documented using a DOC_* class demand a Note construct, as well as a Class, Class-features do not. With a Class-feature, the feature comment may be sufficient along with the feature name and signature. However, when the feature name and comment are not enough to provide you with a learning context that includes relevant orientation and context material, then the notes are added to fulfill this role in your learning process.

Appendix A - Definitions

Sample Category Definitions:
----------------------------
title: Full title of the class if it cannot be computed from the actual class name (e.g. EV_* = Eiffel Vision *)

description: A brief description of what the class represents or is an abstraction of.

brief: More information when the description is not enough.

purpose: What is the purpose of the software element? What is the problem-space? What are the use-cases?

how: How does the software element fulfill its purpose?

prerequisites: Items to be learned first before learning the current software element.

basics: Important background info, design basics, class (or clusters) that need understanding first, closely related classes, and anything else the reader needs for understanding.

usage: Brief descriptive overview of how to use the software element (library, cluster, class, class-feature).

generics: Description of the meaning and use of generic parameters as used in the class or class-feature.

compilation: Special instructions with respect to compiling (pre or post-compile time).

history: Description of any historical facts leading to the present state of the software element ("How did we get here?" and "Did we change course and why?").

BNF: A Backus-Naur form description of the software element (as needed).

BNF_info: Notes and explanations required in support of the BNF.

examples: Examples of the software element being pragmatically applied or used according to its intended design use (problem-space use-case).
