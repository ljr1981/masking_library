OVERVIEW
========
Documentation for this library can be found in the DOC_* classes (start with DOC_LIBRARY_MASK) and are best interactively viewed through the Eiffel Studio IDE from the "mask:test" ECF target.

NOTE: Except for Pick-and-Drop, all documentation files are "Notepad-friendly". Eiffel Studio is not required. However, for a better experience, Eiffel Studio is recommended.

DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE
=======================
Starting with DOC_LIBRARY_MASK, you can learn about the library at a high level, then drill down to the clusters, and finally to the classes. You will also find examples in either the masking demo or in the *_TEST classes of the test target.


WHAT TO EXPECT
==============
When you open the DOC_LIBRARY_MASK class, notice the documentation structure.

Library, Cluster, Class, and Class-feature level notes are expressed as Note-entry constructs (see ECMA-367 8.4.3 Page 34). 

Each Note-name represents a category of information (e.g. title, description, purpose, how, and so on). 

The categories are arranged for top-down reading (e.g. Familiar-reader --> Less-familiar-reader). 

Familiar readers ought to find the information at the top of the notes sufficient.

Less-familiar readers will want to read more of the note items to gain orientation and understanding.

Notes are provided for the library, all clusters, and all classes of interest to you in order to use this library.

Some Class-features have additional notes as-needed or required to help you learn and reuse quickly.


NEXT!
=====
Now--You are ready to open Eiffel Studio and open the "mask", "mask_demo", or "test" target for this library.

"mask" 		--> What you will reference in your own project for reuse.
"mask_demo"	--> To see a demonstration of the library at-work.
"test"		--> To learn more about the library and see how it is tested (as well as other examples).
